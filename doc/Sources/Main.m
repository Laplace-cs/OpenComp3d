%   OpenComp3d is a framework developed at Laplace laboratory to perform
%   automatic design of power electronics

% <h2>General overview of OpenComp3d</h2>
% <p>OpenComp3d is an environnment where all the physical components that can
% construct a power converter are modelled (magnetic elements, capacitors,
% heat sinks...). All this components are described using a <b>direct
% modelling</b> approach, that is, using their physical dimensions,
% materials and shape. In this section, the working principle alongside
% with basic examples of utilization are presented.</p>

% <br></br>
% <h2>OpenComp3d Component Library</h2>
% <p> In this section, the reader can have a deep understanding of the way
% the different Comp3d components are used.</p>

% <h2>Documentation about OOTEE usage</h2>
% Electrical models of OpenComp3d components are implemented with the formalism of a software named "Ootee".
% Ootee is a Matlab package which provides a solver to carry out high speed simulation for
% (pre)design purpose. The main idea is making easier handling and combination of
% models, in order to be able to modify system topology and properties very quickly.
% Unfortunately, Ootee is not available under free license and the startup
% <a href="https://powerdesign.tech/contact/"> Power Design Technologies </a>
% should be contacted to get a license.

% <h2>How to define an optimization problem</h2>
% <p>The framework has a series of implemented functionalities to help in
% the optimal design of power converters. In this section, the working principle 
% of the optimization process and the basics of the code to perform an optimization
% are shown</p>

% <h2>Optimization examples</h2>
% <p>Some particular examples of usage for the Comp3d library.</p>
% <a href="html/OptimizationExamplesList.html"> Optimization Examples </a>
% <br></br>
% <h2>Sweeping analysis</h2>
% <p>A specific tool to look sensibility of the models to the different
% inputs or several parameters, can be used as well to look the
% variation of the optimal result when a parameter is changed.</p>
