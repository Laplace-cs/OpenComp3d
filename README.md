# OpenComp3d
OpenComp3d is an environnment where all the physical components that can construct a power converter can be modelled (magnetic elements, capacitors, heat sinks...).
All this components are described using a direct modelling approach, that is, using their physical dimensions, materials and shape.
To get more information, you can have a look in the 'doc' directory.
